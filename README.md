- **Advanced file search**: Find your files quickly with powerful **search** and **sort** functionalities. More information below.

## Intuitive Advanced Search

The Dashboard navigator search allows you to quickly access and filter specific files within your vault. Quickly find notes, images, canvases, audios, videos, PDFs, and more with simple commands.


### Basic Commands

- `@notes`: Lists all **notes**.
- `@images`: Lists all **images**.
- `@canvas` or `@canvases`: Lists all **canvases**.
- `@audios`: Lists all **audio** files.
- `@videos`: Lists all **video** files.
- `@pdf` or `@pdfs`: Lists all **PDF** files.
- `@other`: Lists all **other** file types.

### Advanced Filtering with Search Terms

You can combine the basic commands with search terms to narrow down your results:

* `@notes #tag1`: Lists **notes** with the tag `#tag1`.
* `@notes desired_word #tag2`: Lists **notes** with `desired_word` and `#tag2`.

### Date-Based Filtering

You can also filter content based on specific dates:

- Enter `@` + the keywords below to quickly filter the results:
  - `@day` (or today)
  - `@day-1` (yesterday)
  - `@day-2` to `@day-7`
  - `@week`
  - `@month`
  - `@year`

### Search Filters Shorthands
- **File categories shorthands**: 
  - `@notes` or `@n`.
  - `@images` or `@i`.
  - `@canvas` or `@canvases` or `@c`.
  - `@audios` or `@a`.
  - `@videos` or `@v`.
  - `@pdf`or `@pdfs` or `@p`.
  - `@other`or `@others` or `@o`.
- **Date filters shorthands**: 
  - `@d` (current day) or `@day` or `@today`.
  - `@d-1` or `@day-1` or `@yesterday`.
  - `@d-2` or `@day-2` to `@d-7` or `@day-7`.
  - `@w` or `@week`.
  - `@m` or `@month`.
  - `@y` or `@year`.

### Combining Search Terms, File Types and Date Filters

You can combine search terms, file types (one per search) and date filters for more precise results:

- `@notes #tag1 @month`: Lists **notes** with the tag `tag1` created/modified this month (*Shorthand*: `@n #tag1 @m`).
- `@images @week`: Lists **images** added this week (*Shorthand*: `@i @w`).


### Additional Tips

* **Case Sensitivity:** Search terms are **case-insensitive**.

* **Multiple Commands:** You can use **multiple commands in a single query**, separated by spaces.

* Feel free to experiment with different combinations of commands and filters to find the best way to access your content. For example: `@month @notes` and `@notes @month` (same effect -> lists notes created/modified in the month). You can even expand this search with `@month @notes title_of_the_note` (or part of the note title, or tag).

### Excluding Results

To exclude specific content from your search results, you can use the `!` exclamation point followed by the text, tag or folder you want to exclude. This will remove any items that match the exclusion term.

**Example:**

- `@notes #work #pending !#urgent`: This will list **all notes** tagged with `#work` and `#pending` except those tagged with `#urgent`.

### Combining Exclusions with Other Filters

You can combine exclusions with other filters, such as tags and date, to further refine your search:

- `@notes #meeting !#international @month`: This will list all notes tagged with `#meeting` that were created or modified this month, **excluding** those tagged with `#international`.

- To find all notes tagged `#meeting` created/modified in the current month: `@notes #meeting @month`.

By effectively using exclusions, you can tailor your searches to your specific needs and quickly find the information you're looking for.
